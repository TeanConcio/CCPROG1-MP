    "The garment industry is a labor-intensive sector heavily dependent on manual processes. This reliance presents several challenges, including maintaining high levels of productivity, ensuring consistent quality, and managing the workforce efficiently. With increasing competition and the need for rapid turnaround times, optimizing these processes becomes crucial for industry stakeholders. As such, tracking, analyzing, and predicting productivity and performance of factory teams is highly desirable. With that in mind, the problem/task that will be targeted in this notebook is a regression problem focusing on predicting productivity."

    "Linear regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a continuous dependent variable (target). It assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the target, with the goal of finding the best-fitting line that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values. Linear regression is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and interpretable, making it suitable for understanding relationships and making predictions. It performs well when the relationship between variables is approximately linear and is supported by statistical measures to evaluate the model's performance (Ross, 2010). However, it has limitations, such as sensitivity to outliers, reliance on assumptions like linearity and constant variance of errors, and difficulty handling multicollinearity or high-dimensional data. It may also struggle to capture complex or nonlinear relationships without additional transformations or feature engineering(Iqbal, 2020). "
